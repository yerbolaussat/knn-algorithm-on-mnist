# Implementation of k nearest neighbors classification algorithm

k-NN algorithm was implemented in python. Next, the algorithm was applied to the problem of classifying handwritten digits from images. The performance of the algorithm with different number of neighbors was examined. The results are summarized in a write-up.

[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data set of handwritten digits was used in this experiment.
